This `Cookiecutter <https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter>`_ template is
designed to help you to bootstrap modules for `Invenio
<https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio>`_. It offers you the following
features:

- **Python package:** Python package for your module including `version`
  submodule.
- **Boilderplate files:** `README` including important badges, `AUTHORS` and
  `CHANGES` file.
- **License:** `GPL 2 <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_ file and
  headers. Headers optionally include a special paragraph for
  Intergovernmental Organizations like CERN. Provides these headers as
  reusable files for Python and reStructuredText.
- **Installation:** Installation script written as `setup.py` and a
  requirements calculator for different levels (`min`, `pypi`, `dev`).
- **Tests:** Test setup using `pytest <http://pytest.org/latest/>`_ and
  configuration for `Tox <https://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_.
- **Documentation:** Documentation generator using `Sphinx
  <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`_. Also includes all files required for `Read the
  Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_. Mocking module to simulate not-installed
  requirements for faster documentation building.
- **Continues Integration:** Support for `Travis <https://travis-ci.org/>`_
  which tests all three requirement levels and adds coverage tests using
  `Coveralls <https://coveralls.io/>`_.
- **Your toolchain:** Ignores a decent set of files when working with GIT and
  `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_. Gets your editor to adapt project
  guidelines by providing a `EditorConfig <http://editorconfig.org/>`_ file.
